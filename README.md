# cornell-notes-html
Simple cornell note taking system. (Work In Progress)

# End goal
End goal with this project is to allow you to easily write notes in the browser with pretty looks.

# Flexibility
You can literally modify css to your own liking to make it your taste and style, I provided simple css to make it look better to start with.
I used offline jQuery so that it may work with or without wifi.

# Currently
You can write html code right now to write notes. I personally use brackets so that I can view it in real time.

I repurposed &lt;ul&gt; tags to be a note level and collapsed and make it clickable (via jQuery). If it has children, I made it blue, otherwise I made it black so that you can tell if it's clickable or not.

To add a subnote to note, simply add &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; inside of one of the &lt;li&gt; tags. This will allow jQuery and css work for sublevels.
